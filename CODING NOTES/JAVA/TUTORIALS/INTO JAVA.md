### ***About Java:*** ###
- JAVA is an `Object Oriented Programming Language`
- Used in
	1. Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.
	2. Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.
	3. Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
	4. Mobile
	5. Embedded System
	6. Smart Card
	7. Robotics
	8. Games, etc.
- Java is `faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages` because Java bytecode is "close" to native code. It is still a little bit `slower than a compiled language` (e.g., C++).` Java is an interpreted language that is why it is slower than compiled languages`, e.g., C, C++, etc.
- Java is a `dynamic language`. It supports the `dynamic loading of classes`. It means classes are loaded on demand. It also `supports functions from its native languages, i.e., C and C++`.

### ***Oops:*** ###
- Java is an [object-oriented](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-oops-concepts) programming language. Everything in Java is an `object`. Object-oriented means we `organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior`.
- Basic concepts of OOPs are:
	1. [Object](https://www.javatpoint.com/object-and-class-in-java)
	2. [Class](https://www.javatpoint.com/object-and-class-in-java#class)
	3. [Inheritance](https://www.javatpoint.com/inheritance-in-java)
	4. [Polymorphism](https://www.javatpoint.com/runtime-polymorphism-in-java)
	5. [Abstraction](https://www.javatpoint.com/abstract-class-in-java)
	6. [Encapsulation](https://www.javatpoint.com/encapsulation)

### ***Platform Independent:*** ###

- Java is a `write once, run anywhere` language
- Java provides a `software-based platform`.
- The Java platform differs from most other platforms in the sense that it is a software-based platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms It has two components:
	1. Runtime Environment
	2. API(Application Programming Interface)
- Java code can be `executed on multiple platforms`, for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. Java code is `compiled by the compiler` and `converted into bytecode`. This `bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can be run on multiple platforms`, i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA).
